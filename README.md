# 01-html-css-git-homework-demo

As part of the first homework assignment, the website I have been provided I have refactored to be more accessible for people with disabilities. The features I have added include braille keyboards, video captions, and screen readers. 

I have also made changes in the CSS and HTML files, I have removed a lot of bloat and tried to condense the code to be more simple and easy to read.
